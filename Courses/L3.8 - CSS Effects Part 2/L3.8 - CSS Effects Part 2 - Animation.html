    <!-- 
        Animation:
        - Animation makes it possible to animate the transitions between styles. In CSS, animation includes a description of a style and 
        a specific set of master frames that define the start, end, and sometimes intermediate state of the styles that are being animated.

        The following properties can be used to control animation:
            * animation-name - defines the name of the @keyframes that sets up the frames of the animation.
            * animation-duration - determines the time of one animation cycle.
            * animation-timing-function - sets the animation acceleration.
            * animation-delay - sets the delay between the time the element loads and the time the animation starts.
            * animation-iteration-count - determines the number of repetitions of the animation; for infinite repetition of animation, the infinite value is used.
            * animation-direction - has alternative path each time the animation is repeated, or reset all values and repeat the animation.
            * animation-fill-mode - sets the values used by the animation before and after execution.
            * animation-play-state - allows you to pause and resume the animation.

        Note that there is a generic property animation, that has the following sub-properties: animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, 
        animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, animation-play-state.
