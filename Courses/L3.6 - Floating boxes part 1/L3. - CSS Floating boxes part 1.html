        Floating Concept
        - Float element is called an element, are floated around the outline by other web page objects, such as text. 
        Such elements are used when laying out web pages for: floating images with text, creating sidebars, horizontal menus, 
        photo galleries, two and three column layouts.


        Features of Use
        - If the element has a property float with a value float: left or float: right, then it becomes a block element and 
        the property display with a value block is automatically added to it. In this case, the width of the element is equal to 
        its content plus the values of the properties padding, border and margin. This way the element behaves like an inline-block element.
        - The element with a property float are horizontal to each other. According to a value  left it is from the left to right, 
        and according to the value right â€” from the right to left. When the element closest to the floated element does not have enough space 
        in width, it floats to the next line.
        - The action float can be continued beyond the parent if the height of the floated element is greater than the height of the parent.
        -> These floating features can negatively affect the layout of a Web page. To avoid the situations described above and achieve the desired 
        result, it is required to cancel the action of the property float at the right moments using different methods.


        
        Advantages of using float:
        * All browsers support this property.
        * Easy to float text around an image.
        * Sometimes such feature is used: the element that has the property float:right is placed second in order (from the right) on a 
        two-column page, despite the fact that it is the first element in the HTML source code.

        Desadvantages of using float:
        * Not used for centering (horizontal or vertical).
        * To avoid display and layout problems, the using of floating cancellation is required.
        * If two float elements are encountered, one with a fixed width (px) and one next to it with a dynamic width (%), this can cause 
        layout issues if there isn't enough horizontal space available.
