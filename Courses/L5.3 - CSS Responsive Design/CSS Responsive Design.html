    <title>CSS Advanced - Responsive Design</title>

    <!-- 
    Terminology - Mobilefirst:
        - The term, mobile first could refer to many different concepts, or you may consider this in different levels, such as:
            * a product principle: the business and the production team must focus on the mobile solution first
            * design methodology: start with the mobile, and create other versions later based on the starting point - the mobile
            * a low-level implementation approach: the first CSS is created for the mobile and other versions added with the media query min-width
    

    Adaptive Web Design (AWD):
        - Uses the server to detect the device/ user/ network the website is being viewed on (desktop, tablet, smartphone) and sends specific files for that device.
        - It usually means different .css files, different images and many times different documents (HTML) with different features as well.
        - While many parts can be shared between the variations, we need to develop (+ test and maintain) different versions of the same site.
        
        - Even the term “Adaptive” are used in different ways: adaptive could mean adaptive in any way (on client side as well).
        - Here, we need to focus on solutions and technologies ,i.e., the adaptivity could happen on:
            * backend, server-side
            * client-side
        ... and usually, it happens in both ways to an extent.


    Responsive Web Design:
        - Uses the client-side to detect the device features (e.g., width, resolution) to utilize specific content (CSS, media) providing 
        different user experience for different devices/viewport widths.

    
    Media queries:
        - Media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
        - They are a key component of responsive design. Forexample, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between 
        paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touch screens.
        - In CSS, use the @media at-rule to conditionally apply part of a style sheet based on the result of a media query. 
        Use @import to conditionally apply an entire style sheet.
    

    Media Types:
        * all - Suitable for all devices.
        * print - Intended for paged material and documents viewedonascreen inprintpreviewmode.
        * screen - Intended primarily for screens.
        * speech - Intended forspeechsynthesizers.

        Example: 
            @media screen and (min-width: 900px) 
                { article { 
                    padding: 1rem 3rem; 
                    }
                }
    
    Logical operators:
        * and - Used for combining multiple media features together into a single media query. It is also used for joining media features with media types.
        * not - Used to negate a media query, returning true if the query would otherwise return false.
        * only - Prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.
        * , - Commas are used to combine multiple media queries into a single rule.
    

    Media Features:
        - Media features describe specific characteristics of the user agent, output device, or environment. Media feature expressions test for their presence or 
        value, and are entirely optional.
        - Each media feature expression must be surrounded by parentheses.
        - While there are many different media features, you will predominantly use the width (width of the viewport including width of scrollbar)
    

    Media Features-width:
        - Basically, it is used it as min-width and max-width
        - The width CSS media feature can be used to test the width of the viewport (or the page box,for paged media).
        - The width featureis specified as a <length> value representing the viewport width. It is a range feature, 
        meaning that you can also use the prefixed min-width and max-width variants to query minimum and maximum values, respectively.


            /* Minimum width */ 
            @media (min-width: 320px) { 
                div { 
                    background: yellow; 
                } 
            }

            /* Maximum width */ 
            @media (max-width: 768px) { 
                div { 
                    border: 2pxsolidblue; 
                } 
            }
    
    
    Breakpoints:
        - Breakpoints will determine the layout at particular view port widths.
        - The more break point you create, the more bugs control you have over the user experience.

        /* Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up) */ 
        @media (min-width: 576px) {...}

        /* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
        @media (min-width: 768px) {...}

        /* Large devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
        @media (min-width: 992px) {...}

        /*Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
        @media (min-width: 1200px) { ...}
        

        /*Minimum width -> mobile first approach */
        @media (min-width: 320px) {
            div {
                background: yellow;
            }
        }


        /*Maximum width -> desktop first approach */
        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            div {
                border: 2pxsolidblue;
            }
        }


        /* Maximum width -> range */
        @media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 768px) {
            div {
                border: 2px solid blue;
            }
        }
