        What is position used for? Position issues.
        - There are five types of position: normal, absolute, fixed, relative, and sticky. When you use different combinations 
        of properties position, left, top, right and bottom, it is possible to overlay elements on each other, display at a point 
        with certain coordinates, fix elements at a specified position, determine the position of one element relative to another, and so on. 
        By controlling positioning, you can dynamically change the position of elements without reloading the page, creating animation and various effects.

        position: static
        - HTML elements are positioned static by default.
        - Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
        - An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

        position: relative
        - The value relative is similar to static in that relatively positioned elements.
        - The main difference is that using relative positioning now unlocks other CSS layout properties:
            * The element is positioned relative to other elements on the page.
            * Properties top, right, bottom, left can be applied.
            * The element keeps its proportions and the space reserved for it.
            * Child elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to this block.
            !Important: Using position: relative on an element does not change the normal flow and does not affect other elements.

        position: absolute
        - With absolute positioning, the element is removed from the normal flow. The nearest elements take its place. And the element itself is 
        assigned a position relative to the nearest positioned parent or viewport window.
